        <p> The Monopoly Board Game, particularly its Classic Edition, is an iconic board game known worldwide for its engaging blend of strategy, chance, and finance. Originally created in the early 20th century, Monopoly has since become a staple in households and a popular choice for family game nights. The game's objective is straightforward yet captivating: players move around the board, buying, trading, and developing properties, with the aim to bankrupt their opponents. 

          As players roll dice to navigate the board, they land on properties they can choose to purchase or pay rent on if owned by another player. The board also features special spaces like 'Chance' and 'Community Chest,' which can bring unexpected twists with cards that either reward or penalize players. Players can improve their properties with houses and hotels,
          increasing the rent owed by other players who land there. The game is known for its iconic tokens, like the top hat and the Scottie dog, and for features like 'Go to Jail' and 'Free Parking'. A mix of luck, strategy, and negotiation skills are required to play Monopoly.</div>

        <p><strong> A personal watercraft for recreational use .</strong><h3 style="color: rgba(250, 250, 250, 0.295);">$8,000</h3></p>
        <p> 
          Jet Skis, a popular term often used to refer to personal watercraft (PWC), are small, jet-propelled vehicles that ride on water and are used for recreational purposes. 
          
          Interesting facts about Jet Skis and personal watercraft:
          
          Origin and Brand: The term "Jet Ski" is actually a brand name of personal watercraft manufactured by Kawasaki. However, it has become a generic term for all personal watercraft of similar use and design,
          much like how the brand name "Kleenex" is often used to refer to all facial tissues.
          
          Design and Use: Jet Skis are designed for individual or small group entertainment on water. They are similar to a motorcycle but for water use, with the rider either sitting or standing on them. They are propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft.
          
          History: The development of personal watercraft can be traced back to the 1950s. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that Kawasaki introduced the first commercially successful Jet Ski.
          
          
           Modern Jet Skis can reach speeds of over 60 miles per hour and are powered by inboard engines that drive a jet pump. They are known for their agility and ability to make sharp turns on water.
          
          when it comes to Safety and Regulations: Operating a Jet Ski requires adherence to certain safety protocols, such as wearing a life jacket. In many regions, there are also age and licensing requirements for riders.
          
          Environmental Impact: The environmental impact of Jet Skis has been a subject of discussion. Newer models are designed to be more environmentally friendly, with improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.
          
          Price Range: The cost of a new Jet Ski can range widely, typically starting from around $5,000 to $20,000, depending on the model, features, and brand.
          
          Popular Brands: Besides Kawasaki, other major manufacturers of personal watercraft include Yamaha (WaveRunners) and Sea-Doo, each offering a range of models with different features and capabilities. </div>
